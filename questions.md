<h1>Customization 1</h1>

<h2>1. What are some of the best practices for creating effective wire-frames in computer science? How do wire-frames help with the design process?</h2>
<p>Define the purpose: Before creating wireframes, it's essential to define the purpose and goals of the project. This helps in creating a clear direction and understanding of the user needs.

Keep it simple: The main purpose of wireframes is to provide an outline of the design. Therefore, it's essential to keep them simple, minimalistic, and easy to understand. Avoid adding too much detail that might distract the user from the main objective.</p>

<h2>2. How does user testing play a role in the design of user interfaces and wire-frames in computer science? Can you provide an example of a project where user testing significantly impacted the final product design?</h2>

<p>User testing plays a crucial role in the design of user interfaces and wireframes in computer science. It involves gathering feedback from real users to understand how they interact with a product, identify usability issues, and gather insights for improvement. By conducting user testing, designers can create user-centered designs that meet the needs of their target audience.</p>

<h2>1. What is Bootstrap and how is it useful n developing websites?</h2>

<p>Bootstrap is a popular open-source front-end development framework that allows developers to create responsive, mobile-first websites quickly and easily. It includes a collection of CSS, JavaScript, and HTML templates that can be used as the basis for building websites and web applications.</p>

<h2>2. What are the benefits of using Bootstrap in web development compared to css?</h2>

<p>Faster Development: Bootstrap provides pre-built components, such as navigation menus, forms, and modals, that can be easily customized and used in web development. This saves a significant amount of time in developing and styling these components from scratch using CSS.</p>

<h2>3. How can you include Bootstrap in YOUR website development?</h2>

<p>im building a website that displays NBA statistics, and i want to display the top 10 players by scoring average. i can use Bootstrap to create a responsive table that displays this information in a user-friendly way.</p>

<h2>4. What do selectors do? Explain one selector in your own words.</h2>

<p>In CSS, selectors are used to target HTML elements on a webpage and apply styles to them. Selectors allow you to specify which elements you want to style and how you want to style them.</p>

<h1>JavaScript</h1>

<h2>1. What are examples of selection, iteration, and sequencing in the snake game?</h2>
<p>The game checks if the snake has eaten a food item. If it has, the length of the snake is increased and a new food item is generated.

The game loop continues to run until the game is over, with the game logic being executed in a continuous loop.

At the start of the game, the snake and food items are initialized and positioned on the game board.</p>
<h2>2. How does ":root" contribute to the customization of the game?</h2>

<p>In CSS, the ":root" selector targets the root element of a document, which is typically the <html> element. By using the ":root" selector, you can define CSS variables that can be used throughout your stylesheet. These variables can then be customized in one place, making it easy to make global changes to your styles.</p>

<h2>3. Write 2-3 sentences about how the use of HTML, JavaScript, and CSS creates the final product.</h2>

<p>HTML, JavaScript, and CSS are the three primary technologies used to create the final product of a website or web application. HTML provides the structure and content of the webpage, JavaScript provides interactivity and dynamic behavior, and CSS provides styling and visual design. Together, these technologies work seamlessly to create a fully functional and visually appealing website or web application.</p>
